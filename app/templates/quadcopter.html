                <p>
                    If you love the idea of building your own quadcopter but haven’t got a clue how and where to start, you are definitely on the right page. 
                    We know how difficult and frustrating the research can be, so we decided to make a tutorial for building your own quadcopter using an Arduino board. 
                    We hope that you will find it useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, to get you even more excited about your upcoming project, here is an Arduino quadcopter in action:
                </p>
                <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">                
                    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwSMbRkMw9c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div><br><br>

                <!-- Getting Started -->
                <h3 id="general" >Before We Get Started</h3>
                <p>
                    Building your own quadcopter from the ground up includes plenty of hours and hard work. So, you will require a lot of patience. 
                    We will build our quadcopter from ground up, avoiding the need to buy any quadcopter kits.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quadcopter kits will deny us the long hours and sweat invested in building, 
                    and getting to understand the essence of your bird and how it ticks. 
                    Also, you will miss out on the overwhelming feeling of satisfaction when you take off with your handmade quad for the first time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, unlike the traditional helicopter, the quad relies on its four rotors to generate uplifting thrust by working together. 
                    Every single rotor lifts around a quarter of the overall weight, which allows us to use smaller and less expensive motors. 
                    You basically control the movement of the quad by changing the amount of power each motor delivers to its propellers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The motors are positioned in every corner of an imaginary square. On one diagonal, you have two motors that rotate in a clockwise direction,
                    while the remaining two, on the opposite diagonal, rotate counterclockwise. If this wasn’t the case, 
                    the quad would only spin around like a traditional helicopter when the tail rotor dies.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{url_for('static', filename = 'img/quad_rotors.png')}}">
                </div>
                <p>
                    In order for the balance to be maintained, the quad relies on the data it gathers from internal sensors, 
                    and adjusts the power it sends to each motor so that the entire drone is leveled. 
                    To keep balanced all of the time, the quad uses an advanced control system, which usually makes the adjustments autonomously, 
                    and this is where your Arduino board and your programming come into play. This type of self-stabilization will make your drone quite 
                    accessible to fly, as you won’t have to constantly worry about losing control and damaging your quad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually, each quad comes capable of performing four types of movement: Altitude, Roll, Yaw, and Pitch. 
                    Each of these movements is controlled by the amount of thrust each rotor produces. This is why you will need to program your 
                    remote control so that it knows how much power to give and to which rotor to give it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every quadcopter comes with a microcontroller board with sensors on it, in your case – the Arduino board. 
                    This board, together with the components you choose, controls the motors. It is up to you to choose how self-controlling you want your quad to be. 
                    You can use only the basic ones such as the gyro, or a bunch of other, more advanced sensors such as a 
                    barometer, or a GPS, or even a sonar so that your quad can be able to detect and avoid obstacles that are in its way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quads, as with all drones, are highly customizable, and you can truly build one that represents your interests. 
                    This is a major appeal of the DIY process to many enthusiasts. Whether you are interested in photography, video, drone racing, 
                    or just flying for fun, you’ll find that a quadcopter can offer something for you. Unmanned aerial vehicles are very adaptable 
                    and customizable, and we think you’ll enjoy customizing one that suits your preferences.

                <h3 id="resources" >Components You Will Need</h3>            
                <p>
                    Every quad will have to include the elements listed below in order to fly. 
                    Here is a short summation of each of the various parts of a quad, and we will cover these in more detail as the article goes on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#frame" >Frame</a></b> – The “backbone” of the quadcopter. The frame is what keeps all the parts of the helicopter together. 
                        It has to be sturdy, but on the other hand, it also has to be light so that the motors and the batteries don’t struggle 
                        to keep it in the air.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#motors">Motors</a></b> – The thrust that allows the quadcopter to get airborne is provided by Brushless DC motors and 
                        each of them is separately controlled by an electronic speed controller or ESC.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#escs">ESCs</a></b> – Electronic Speed Controller is like a nerve that delivers the movement information from the brain 
                        (flight controller) to the arm or leg muscles (motors). It regulates how much power the motors get, which determines the speed and 
                        direction changes of the quad.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#propellers">Propellers</a></b> – Depending on the type of a quad you build, you can use 9 to 10 or 11-inch props 
                        (for stable, aerial photography flights), or 5-inch racing props for less thrust but more speed.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#battery">Battery</a></b> – Depending on your setup maximum voltage level, you can choose from 2S, 3S, 4S, or even 5S batteries. 
                        But, for a standard for a quad that is planned to be used for aerial filming or photography (just an example), 
                        you will need a 11.4 V 3S battery. You could go with the 22.8 V 4S if you are building a racing quad and you want 
                        the motors to spin a lot faster.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="#arduino-board">Arduino board</a></b> –The choice of the specific model depends on the type of the quadcopter you want to build. 
                        Whether you are building for aerial photography, racing, freestyle, or more. We will talk about the right choice of board 
                        further down the article.

                <h3>Understanding Components</h3>
                <h4 id="frame">Frame</h4>
                <p>
                    Although it might be tempting to buy a preassembled frame kit, building the frame on your own can help you kick start your true DIY process. 
                    The Frame of your quadcopter has to possess strength, but it also has to be flexible enough to compensate for the vibrations the motors produce. 
                    It needs to have the following parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Center Holding Plate</b> – for mounting the electronics.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Arms</b> – there are four arms on a quad.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Motor Brackets</b> – you need four of them so that you can connect the motors on each arms end.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frame can be made of aluminum, carbon fiber or wood but the material that is mostly used for the arms is aluminum. 
                    More precisely, the square hollow rails of the arms are made of aluminum. They are relatively lightweight, rigid and cheap. 
                    But, since they are not known as great compensators for the motor vibrations like carbon fiber ones are, they can confuse the sensors.
                </p><br>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img/Frame-for-your-quad.png') }}"><br>
                <p>
                    Carbon fiber offers much better absorption of the motor vibrations and is the most rigid one. But, it is also the most expensive one. 
                    Carbon fiber is the superior choice, but this very much depends on your personal budget. <br><br>
                    Wood boards are also better for motor vibration absorbtion, but are quite fragile and can break easily in the event of a crash.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>

                <h4 id="motors" >Brushless Motors</h4>
                <p>
                    These motors are almost the same thing as traditional DC motors, but the shaft on them doesn’t come with a brush, which is 
                    there to change the direction of the power that goes through the coils. When buying these motors, you need to check their technical data.
                </p><br>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src=" {{ url_for('static', filename = 'img/brushless_motors.png') }} "><br>
                <p>
                    The most important ones are the “Kv-rating“, which tells you the number of RPMs the motor is capable of generating 
                    with a certain amount of electric power. Also, you will need motors that rotate counter-clockwise, so that they counteract the props torque effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more motors, I suggest these models:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RS2205-2600KV-Brushless-QAV250-Quadcopter/dp/B01CL6W7JC?tag=dronelab-20">razepony 4pcs EMAX RS2205 2600KV Brushless Motor</a></li>                    
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4 id="propellers">Propellers</h4>
                <p>
                    Propellers generate thrust, and each motor needs one in order for the quad to fly. Make sure that you buy the proper rotating pairs 
                    of propellers for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. They can be bought in various pitches and diameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have to choose the propellers according to the size of your frame, and once you have decided which propellers you will use, 
                    only then you can choose your motors. Propellers are standardized, and here are the most used ones for quads:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 pitch, 8 diameter – Small quads</li>
                    <li>8 pitch, 9 diameter – Small quads</li>
                    <li>5 pitch, 10 diameter – Medium-sized quads</li>
                    <li>7 pitch, 10 diameter – Medium-sized quads</li>
                    <li>5 pitch, 12 diameter– Provide plenty of thrusts and are great for quads that are larger</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Since aerodynamics is just more than confusing and difficult to understand if you are not an Engineer in Aerodynamics, 
                    we will explain a few important terms in a few words.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/propellers.png') }}"><br>
                <p>
                    First, the larger the diameter and pitch are, the more thrust will the propeller produce. It will need more power, but the quadcopter 
                    will be capable of lifting more weight. For high RPM motors, you need smaller or mid-sized propellers. For low RPM motors, 
                    you need the larger propellers so that they can keep the quad in the air at lower speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, to achieve the perfect balance between the motors and propellers, you first need to decide what you will use the quad for. 
                    For example, if you want to build a stable and powerful enough quad to lift filming and photography equipment, you should use a 
                    motor with less RPM’s and more torque, and longer or higher pitched propellers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want good performance propellers we recommend you to get any of these:

                    The device that is in charge of controlling the speed of the motors is a cheap controller board, used only for motors. 
                    It comes with an input for a battery, and has a motor output with three phases, so you will need four of them for each motor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When buying the proper ESC, you need to pay attention to the max level of the current that comes from the source. Choose a controller
                    with 10A or higher. Also, you need to check how programmable it is, meaning that you need to buy an ESC that will allow you to change 
                    the signal frequency range to the value you want.

                <h4 id="battery">Battery</h4>
                <p>
                    The most recommended power source for your quadcopter is the LiPo. It’s not heavy, and the current levels are ideal for what you need. 
                    NiMH is a cheaper, but also heavier, option.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img/batteries.png') }}"><br>
                <p>
                    LiPo batteries come as a single 3.7V cell or packed together as one (up to 10 cells which provide 37V).
                    The most popular version among the drone hobbyists is known as the 3SP1 battery, which comes with three cells and provides 11.1V.
                    Here is a good one: <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html?___store=en_us">Zippy Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C</a>

                <h4 id="imu">IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)</h4>
                <p>
                    This unit is in charge of measuring the quad’s orientation, velocity, and the force of gravity. This allows the electronics to 
                    control the amount of power sent to motors, in order to adjust the motors’ speeds. The unit comes equipped with a 3-axis gyroscope, 
                    and a 3-axis accelerometer. This combination is known as the 6DOF IMU. Check this one out: <a href="https://pickstuff.com/products/knacro-6508-imu-mpu6050-mpu-6050-6dof-attitude-module-serial-gyroscope-acceleration-sensor">KNACRO 6508 IMU MPU6050 MPU-6050 6DOF </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gyroscope is there to read the values of angular velocity, while the accelerometer is in charge of measuring acceleration and force, 
                    meaning that it can feel the downwards gravity. Since it comes with three-axis sensors, it can sense the orientation of the quad.

                <h4 id="rc-controller">Flight Controller</h4>
                <p>
                    You can either choose to use a controller board that’s only purpose is to control a quadcopter, or you can choose an

                    This is a general purpose microcontroller that allows you to build your own flight controller by buying the parts you want to install, 
                    and assembling the controller on your own.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img/arduino-uno.jpg') }}"><br>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in getting started with electronics and coding, the Arduino UNO is the best possible board you can use. 
                    It is the most reliable and robust platform, and it allows you to literally play with it any way you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best thing about this board is that it allows you to mess with it and not worry about destroying it. The worst thing you can do to it 
                    is fry the chip, which luckily can be replaced with only a couple of dollars.
                </p>

                <h4 id="transmitter">Transmitter</h4>
                <p>
                    The most common way of programming and controlling a quadcopter is by an RC transmitter. You can usually choose between two modes,
                    Acrobatic or Stable.<br><br>
                    For controlling the quad in Acrobatic mode, the Gyroscope is the only one which sends the values to processing. 
                    In this case, the controlling sticks are there only for controlling and setting the speed of rotation for the three axes, 
                    and if you let go of them, the values are not re-balanced automatically.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid center-block" style = "max-width:100%; height: auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img/rc-transmitter.png') }}"><br>
                <p>
                    This comes in handy for those who want to perform aerial stunts, because tilting the drone a bit is possible, 
                    and after the release of the sticks, the quad keeps the position. It’s not a good mode for beginners because it is quite 
                    difficult to control your quad in this mode. Basically, the more skill you have at controlling the drone, 
                    the less help you will likely want with stability. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when you’re a beginner drone user, use the second mode of control, because for determining the drone’s orientation, 
                    every single sensor works in this mode. The motor speeds will be controlled automatically, and the drone will be balanced on its own.
                </p>

                    This is the most complicated part of the entire building process. Soldering is a very specific technique, so be sure to do this process carefully. 
                    Make sure you know exactly what you need to do before you start each step. For this, you will need the following:
